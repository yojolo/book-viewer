# Book Viewer
*(I have to find a better name...)*

A simple viewer with book page style.
The idea is to provide a simple interface to create and manage "book-like" presentations.
With an administrator interface you can create a new book and add pages to it.
After that you can share your book with people you want by link.

It's a project I start to practice AngularJS.

Currently, I use this stuff to power my webapp.

For the frontend :
- Angular JS (https://angularjs.org/)
- Angular Material for the UI (https://material.angularjs.org)

For the backend :
- A Php API with SQLite or maybe some obscure NoSQL database. I didn't decide yet...
